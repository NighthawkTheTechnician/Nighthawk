## Dear colleague's

To whomsoever is reading this. 

Greetings, I'm Mason, a 'Computer Scientist' who happens to be interested in many computational fields: cybersecurity, cryptography, embedded, freelance, full stack, machine learning, networking, and other related tasks. I also enjoy digging around at the hardware level as well as machine level, and always working within my own limts/boundaries. 

Outside of the computer world. I enjoy playing several musical instruments, such as: acoustic guitar, bass, drums, electric guitar, and piano. Then there is reading books based on: complex mathematics data structures and algorithms, poetry, or things that peak genuine interest.
